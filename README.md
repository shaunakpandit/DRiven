# Automated Installation of Riven, Plex (Optional), and Zurg with rclone

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/W7W517M4V1)

This script simplifies the installation of Riven and provides optional setups for Plex Media Server and Zurg, integrated with rclone. For Windows users, it also automatically installs WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and Docker if not already present.

**Now support both traditional root and rootless Docker installations**

## Prerequisites

- You will need your **Real-Debrid API token** to integrate Real-Debrid with Riven and Zurg. To obtain your token, visit [Real-Debrid API Token](https://real-debrid.com/apitoken) and generate it.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Directory
- Place all the provided bash scripts in the directory where you intend to run your Docker containers.

### Step 2: Start the Installation
- Follow the appropriate steps for your operating system, ensuring you use **sudo/admin privileges** during the process.

### Step 3: Configure Plex Media Library

Once Zurg and rclone have been initiated and the necessary mounts have been set up, the script will automatically create two important directories for your Plex Media Server:

- `/mnt/library/movies`: This folder will store your movie collection.
- `/mnt/library/shows`: This folder will store your TV shows.

####**This should be configured after the script went through Plex Setup.**

#### Linux Systems:
1. Open a terminal with the necessary permissions.
2. Start the installation by running:

    ```bash
    sudo bash ./main_setup.sh
    ```

#### Windows Systems:
1. The script will automatically install WSL if it’s not already on your system.
2. **Important**: Open **Terminal** as an **Administrator**.
3. In WSL, start the installation by running:

    ```bash
    ./windows_install.bat
    ```

4. If WSL was installed during this process, set up a username and password when prompted. After WSL starts, type `exit` to continue. Use the newly created password when needed.

5. **Troubleshooting Tip**: If you’re unable to access the Riven site after installation, run:

    ```bash
    .\windows_proxy.bat
    ```
### windows_proxy.bat: Proxy WSL Docker Bridge IP to Machine IP

The `windows_proxy.bat` script is designed to simplify access to Docker containers running inside WSL by binding the Docker network's bridge (NAT) IP (typically in the 172.x.x.x range) to your Windows machine's IP address.

This allows any service running inside Docker containers, including Riven, Plex, or other applications, to be accessed using your machine's IP address rather than the internal Docker IP. This makes the containers easily reachable from outside the WSL environment without complex networking setups.

Running `windows_proxy.bat` will ensure that any ports exposed by Docker containers in WSL will be proxied to your machine's IP, providing seamless access to all containerized services.

#### NOTE
- During installation, you’ll have the option to install Plex Media Server.
- Zurg and rclone will be automatically installed **only if they are not present** in the directory. If they are already installed, the script will skip their installation. 
    - Zurg setup can often have an odd bug with setting real-debrid API key. Post install, check `DRiven/zurg/config.yml`. Ensure that API key is correct
  

## Bypass Riven Onboarding with Pre-Configured Settings

A new feature has been added that allows you to bypass the onboarding process for Riven by automatically configuring it with the essential settings required to get started. This simplifies the setup process by providing just enough configuration to launch Riven without manual onboarding steps.

### How It Works:

1. When running the installation script, Riven will automatically be configured with minimal settings, such as:
   - **Real-Debrid Integration**: Uses your API token to integrate Real-Debrid.
   - **Library Path**: Points to the default media library location (`/mnt/library`).
   - **Rclone Path**: Set to `/mnt/zurg/__all__` for remote media access.
   - **Basic User Preferences**: Set to default options for initial startup.

2. After installation, Riven will be ready to use with the basic configuration.

### Optional Customization:

If you want to customize these settings further, you can edit the `settings.json` file located in the `./riven` directory. This allows you to fine-tune your configuration without needing to go through the onboarding process manually.

### Obtaining Your Plex Token:

For Plex integration, you will need to obtain your Plex token. You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/) to retrieve your Plex token.




## Post-Installation Information

After installation, the following default configurations will be set up:

- **Rclone Path**: The default mount point for Rclone is `/mnt/zurg/__all__`. This is where remote media will be accessible for further processing or integration with Riven and Plex.
  
- **Library Path**: The local media library is located at `/mnt/library`, where Riven and Plex scan, manage, and serve your content.

- **Riven Configuration**: You can find the `settings.json` file for Riven in the `riven` folder, located in the same directory where the scripts reside.
    - when logging into riven FE for the first time, the requested backend url is http://riven:8080, and api key is in riven/riven/settings.json

- **Riven Database**: The Riven database is stored in `/home/docker/riven-db`.

- **Zurg/Rclone Information**: Zurg and rclone-related files are located in the `zurg` folder, alongside the installation scripts. If they are already installed, the script will skip their reinstallation.

- **Troubleshooting Logs**: A troubleshooting logs will be generated after running the script will be saved as `troubleshoot-<timestamp>.txt` in the same directory as the script. These logs are provided to help identify potential issues during onboarding or further setup, even if no errors occur.


- **Plex URL**: If you set up Plex using this script, then the Plex's URL for Riven to recognize will be `http://plex:32400`.

You can adjust these paths if needed, but ensure any changes are reflected in the appropriate configuration files to ensure smooth operation across Riven, Plex, and other services.
